# Intro to computing
5 Units
1. Basics
 - Computing    - basic principles of working with computers
 - Programming  - general workflow of writing and running programs
 - Debugging    - process of finding and fixing errors in your programs

2. Procedural Programming
 - General idea of writing sequences of instructions for the comp to perform
 - Variables - creating and modding data in programs
 - Logical Operators - truthy/falsys
 - Mathematical Operators - arithmetic

3. Control Structures
 - General idea of lines of code that can control othe rlines of code
 - Conditionals - if statements that check logical expressions to see if certain code blocks should run
 - Loops - lines of code to repeat until some condition is met
 - Functions - mini programs within larger programs, each with their own input, code and output
 - Exception Handling - lines of code that instruct how to fail gracefully when errors occur

4. Data Structures
 - General idea of data types more compelx than individual letters and numbers
 - String - ordered series of chars that often represent natural human language
 - Lists - ordered seris of other kinds of data collected uner one variable name and accessed via numeric indicies
 - File I/O - writing a programs data to a file so it can later be re-loaded after the program is closed and reopened
 - Dictionaries - paris of key/values collected under one variable name

5. Objects & Algorithms
 - Objects - Creating and using ducstom data types so our pgrogram can reason about the world the way we do
 - Algorithms - Complex sequences of instructions that transform data or generate useful conclusions

# Vocab

* Compile - Translate human-readable code into instructions the computer can execute. This functions as a check on the code the user has written to confirm if makes sense to the computer
* Execution - Running code and having it perform its operations
